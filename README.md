# dotfiles

This repo contains my personal "dotfiles" (environment configuration files). Feel free to copy or clone this repo and make any changes you'd like.

## Prerequisites
- [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh)
- [starship prompt](https://github.com/starship/starship)

## Installation
Clone this repository, along with all of its submodules.

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/drewdavis21/dotfiles.git
```

Copy these files into your home directory (`$HOME` on POSIX systems). That's it! If you want to keep this as a separate git repo, you can set up symbolic links in your home directory to point to files and directories in your repo.
